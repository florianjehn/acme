# ACME

**A**utomated **C**onstruction of **M**odels by **E**volution

## Purpose
ACME is used to automatically construct a lumped, hydrological model for a given discharge, climate and precipitation timeseries. The model will itself will be constructed using the Catchment Modelling Framework [CMF](http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf).

## Features
Using different crossover and mutation techniques in combination with different evaluation schemes from [SPOTPY](http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/).

## Install
to be implemented

## Support
- Feel free to contact the authors of this tool for any support questions.
- Please contact the authors in case of any bug.
- If you use ACME for science, please cite [Here will be a paper someday]().
- Patches and enhancements and any other contribution to ACME are very welcome!

## Getting started (and beyond)
You can either use only the genetic engine itself to define the way you want your CMF model to created or you can use one of the predefined CMF-model-generators.

Or if you are up to a bit larger challenge it is also possible to rewrite the code profided here to work with different model frameworks (e.g. [FUSE](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007WR006735/abstract)). This might be a bit of work especially if the Framework is not written in Python, but well worth a try. Feel free to contact me if you want to undertake this journey.
