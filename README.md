# ACME

**A**utomated **C**onstruction of **M**odels by **E**volution. 

## Purpose
ACME is used to automatically construct a lumped, hydrological model for a given discharge, climate and precipitation timeseries. The model will itself will be constructed using the Catchment Modelling Framework [CMF](http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf)

## Features
Using different crossover and mutation techniques in combination with different evaluation schemes from [SPOTPY](http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/)

## Install
to be implemented
